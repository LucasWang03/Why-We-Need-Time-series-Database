#         Why do we need a time-series database? 

Due to the proliferative use of big data in fields such as e-commerce, media and administration, the number of databases increases steeply and the importance of database draws attention of people. Among a multitude of kinds of database, the time-series database which is purpose-built to process mass of time-series data is rising and getting more popular. 

So why do we need a time-series database?  Why those time-series database have became more popular? I deem that I can give a brief introduction in this article.

### 1. What is time-series database?

First and foremost, we should comprehend the time-series data. Time series data, which is also referred to as time-stamped data, is a sequence of data points indexed in time order. Time-stamped is data collected at different points in time. These data points typically consist of successive measurements made from the same source over a time interval and are used to track change over time. For instance, If we use a thermometer to measure the temperature of a city all the time for a day, and record these temperatures, these are time-series data.

Time-series data is structured and rarely updated or deleted. A collection point's data source is unique, the data must be searched in a specified period and a specified area. It is estimated that more than 10 billion pieces of time-series data are generated every single day. By connecting these data, we can make a multi-latitude report in the past to reveal its tendency, regularity and anomaly. 

In recent years, the application of time-series data exerts a salutary effect in many fields including the IOT, economic and financial field, environmental monitoring, medical, industrial manufacturing, agricultural production field, system monitoring of hardware and software and so on.

Obviously, time-series database is aimed at storing and processing time-series data, and it supports some basic functions such as fast writing of time-series data, persistence, and multi-latitude aggregated query.  Whereas traditional databases only record the current value of data, time-series databases record all historical data. At the same time, time is always used as a filter condition in the query of time series data. 

### 2. The history of time-series database

As shown in the figure above,the development of time-series database can be traced back to the 1990s, when the demand for timing data storage came into being in the monitoring field. The first generation of timing databases, represented by RRDTool and Whisper, using fixed-size databases to rapidly store numerical data over time, it's often embedded in the monitoring system. 
With the development of big data, time-series data has exploded. Not only monitoring systems, but also other systems have more requirements for processing time-series data. In 2011, time-series databases represented by OpenTSDB and KairosDB which are based on distributed storage and optimize for time began to appear.

In 2013, the vertical sequential database represented by InfluxDB has become the mainstream of the time-series database which has more efficient storage, reading and other data processing capabilities and efficient compression algorithms for time-series data.

The figure above explicitly illustrates the development of time-series database, the popularity of time-series database increased quickly from 250 in 2018 to 600 in 2022 which demonstrates that time-series database has become the second most popular database nowadays.

### 3. The advantages of time-series database

+ One stop data solution: 
The industrial Internet of things not only collects the process data generated by the machine, but also carries out real-time calculation and early warning, and displays the results to the operator or directly feeds back to the machine. At the same time, the original process data need to be saved to the database for online or offline query. After accumulating a large amount of historical data, more complex big data mining can be carried out. All this can be done in a system of dolphin dB. The following figure shows the data processing flow of dolphin DB database.
What are the advantages of time series database as the data background of industrial Internet of things?
For system integrators or enterprises, development and maintenance on one system is much lower than integration, development and maintenance on multiple systems in terms of development cost, maintenance cost and hardware procurement cost.

+ Lightweight cross platform deployment: 
Industrial Internet of things platforms are usually very complex. There are not only cheap industrial computer (low configuration PC or embedded system), but also server or server cluster. There are not only edge computing, but also local platform deployment and cloud platform deployment. The operating systems involved include both Linux and windows. There are many open source or commercial time series databases in the market, as well as the related big data ecology, with many complex components and huge volume, and high requirements for software and hardware. It is very difficult to use a set of system for cross platform deployment.
Dolphin DB is a very lightweight system, developed with GNU C + +. The size of the system is only over 20 megabytes, without any dependence. It can be deployed on any of the above platforms. This greatly saves the development and maintenance costs of system integrators.

+ Safe and controllable: 
The security and controllability of data and system of industrial Internet of things platform is very important for an enterprise, even for the country. Dolphin DB is a self-developed distributed temporal database from scratch. From the underlying distributed file system and storage engine, to the database and core class library, to the distributed computing engine, to the script language, to the development interface of various programming languages, and even the peripheral development integration environment GUI, cluster management tools are 100% independent research and development, without any external dependence, safe and controllable.
In addition to supporting x86 and arm instruction system, dolphin DB is also adapting MIPS instruction system to support Loongson and other domestic CPUs. In this way, on the platform of industrial Internet of things, the software and hardware can be controlled independently at the same time.

+ Massive historical data storage and processing: 
The data collection of industrial Internet of things is characterized by high dimension, high frequency, large number of devices, large amount of data and high time precision. At present, most of the MES systems used in manufacturing industry use relational database, which can only save the process data in a very short time, and can not retain the full amount of high-precision data. Due to the limitation of database system, enterprises can not play the value of historical data.
Dolphin DB database adopts column storage, supports data compression (compression rate is about 20%), supports nanosecond precision time series data processing, and supports million level partition for a single table. The storage capacity and computing capacity of dolphin DB cluster can be expanded horizontally by adding nodes. Dolphin DB cluster supports multi replica distributed storage and distributed transaction. When the data of one replica is wrong or lost, it enables the recovery of the other replica to ensure the high availability and strong consistency of data. Enterprises can use the accumulated historical data for in-depth data mining and data analysis, such as predictive maintenance of equipment, improvement of process flow, improvement of product quality, optimization of manufacturing plan and so on.
In short, on the same hardware device, relational database (Oracle, SQL Server) can support hundreds of millions of time series data, and dolphin DB can support hundreds of millions of time series data.

+ Real time stream computing: 
The real-time data collected by the Internet of things can be sent to the stream computing engine of dolphin dB for cleaning, real-time statistics, real-time storage, and real-time visualization. Dolphin DB naturally has the duality of flow table. Publishing a message is equivalent to adding a piece of data to the flow data table. It can directly use SQL to inject and query the flow data, which is very convenient. The flow computing engine of dolphin DB is based on publish subscribe consume mode. The flow data table is used to publish data, and other data nodes or third-party applications subscribe to consumption flow data through dolphin DB script or API to feed back the calculation results to the machine or operator in real time.

### 4. The application scenarios of time-series database

Now TSDB has been widely used in the IOT, enterprise energy management, Internet supervision, power detection system, etc.  

+ IOT device status monitoring analysis. a variety of IOT devices can be connected to the cloud through the platform, and the status data of the devices can be written into the timing database in real time efficiently. It can provide the following three functions: reading real-time data through the data API interface of the time-series database; With the advantage of fast query speed of time series database, data reports are obtained by aggregating the data. The change trend and curve of the data can be obtained visually through the console or objects of the sequential database to help users analyze the data connotation.  

+ Internet service performance monitoring service. Internet service can write user access delay, query return efficiency, and business service indicator monitoring data into the sequential database, which can perform multi-dimensional aggregation analysis and display monitoring items. For example, a website service provider needs to record the clarity, smoothness, clicks, visits and other information of each web page in real time, that is, these monitoring items can be written into the timing database at a certain frequency. According to certain aggregation conditions, which carrier network is smoother in a certain period of time; Look at a site's fluency curve for the past day/week; Find how clicks change over time.  

+ Real-time analysis of big data. User data reported by various acquisition terminals and business status data obtained by log cleaning programs are stored in the timing database. Finally, data is obtained through API to achieve efficient real-time analysis and modeling. 

### 5. What will the future of time-series database be?

The figure above reveals the popularity trend of the last 24 months about DBMS according to DB-engines. We can assert that the time-series database has been the most active and well-regarded DBMS and it's popularity has increasing over time. As time-series data plays a pivot role in many fields, I maintain that TSDB will show it's capabilities and impose a instrumental effect in those fields.

As we can see above, we can assert utterly that  InfluxDB is the most remarkable TSDB in kinds of TSDB because of it's powerful and comprehensive functions. A domestic time-series database---TDengine which is established by TAOS data ranks 13. 

### 6. Summary

Time-series database is in the stage of rapid development, time-series data technology is gradually mature, but this is by no means the end, time-series data technology is still facing a variety of new requirements and challenges. While improving the performance of time-series database, major manufacturers are putting forward more solutions to meet the new requirements. Facing these challenges and opportunities, we believe that time-series database will have further development in the future.
